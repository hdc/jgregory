  <font color="#660000" face="Georgia"><em>A mourner visits a unique cemetery site designed for a group of
 very special friends...in life and in death.</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#660000" face="Georgia">Something caught my eye at a century-old graveyard near where I live in upstate New York.<br>
  <br>
  On a grassy knoll in Chautauqua Cemetery, 32 headstones lay flat on the ground, linked in a kind of oval shape. Except for two that marked the graves of people who had recently died, the rest bore no date of death.<br>
  <br>
  Each polished granite headstone had a name and, in some cases, an epitaph. But they all had only a birth date.<br>
  <br>
  When I came closer, I saw an inscription that explained what the burial site was all about. It said, &quot;A Circle of Friends.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The friends&mdash;the owners of 30 of these 32 burial plots --are alive and have an active interest in their grave site. They have decided to be cremated and have their ashes buried alongside each other. At least once a year, they visit their final resting place.<br>
  <br>
  Every summer, the &quot;plotters&quot; (as they call themselves) hold a cemetery party complete with wine and sometimes champagne. They remember the departed and celebrate another year of life on the right side of the grass.</p>
<p>Cemetery officials say the friends' gravesite may be a new idea. And so I decided to try to find out more about it.<br>
  <br>
  It took only a few days to find the site's designer, Judith Gregory, an artist and sculptor from Davidson, N.C. Gregory, 66, and her husband, Fred, have their second home in Chautauqua Institution, an historic summer cultural center across the road from the 133-year-old cemetery.<br>
  <br>
  To many, death remains a dark and depressing subject. Gregory's group has taken a different tack.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Since death is inevitable,&quot; she said, &quot;we thought we would try to make our grave site something positive. It's comforting to know we will be with our friends after we die in a place we all like.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Gregory said she always regretted seeing her parents' buried in a cemetery so &quot;unattractive and unwelcoming&quot; that she rarely visits. But it motivated her to see that she and her husband had a pleasant-looking grave site.<br>
  <br>
  The idea for a burial spot shared by friends began in an offhand way. Tom Small, a 72-year-old member of a group of summertime neighbors (including Gregory) who go on sight-seeing trips together, heard the Chautauqua cemetery was having a sale of plots.<br>
  <br>
  Small suggested every one in the group buy a plot and plan to be buried next to each other.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Since we're such good friends who journey together in life,&quot; Small said, &quot;why don't we plan to go to eternity together on our last trip?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  He said this with tongue in cheek. The others weren't laughing. They saw the friends' grave site as a reaction to today's trend that sees many families scattered to the four winds. These close-knit friends thought of themselves as replacements for their own faraway families.<br>
  <br>
  Most of the group are retirees who come from wide-ranging backgrounds. Some were lawyers and doctors. Others had jobs in finance and education. There is a computer expert, a librarian, and several sales people. One of the deceased friends, Denny Buch, was an airline pilot.<br>
  <br>
  Perhaps, the best-known was Andrew Sorenson, who died in 2011. He was president of the University of South Carolina and, before that, the president of the University of Alabama.<br>
  <br>
  The group's common bond is the fact that, like Sorenson, they all have vacation homes at Chautauqua, some 90 miles south of Buffalo. Many have come to this lakeside community year after year since childhood.<br>
  <br>
  Each summer, from late June though August, they golf, play tennis, swim,and sail. When they aren't on the move, they go to lectures and symphony concerts in a giant roofed-over amphitheater seating 5,000. <br>
  <br>
  Nine presidents&mdash;including Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Bill Clinton&mdash;have spoken here or visited the 128-year-old cultural center.<br>
  <br>
  Acting on Small's idea, each member of the group bought a cemetery plot for $150. Each also contributed another $1,500 for the design and construction of the gravesite.<br>
  <br>
  The sum also paid for headstones and inscriptions that sometimes included an epitaph. A few are philosophical. <br>
  <br>
  &quot;To make an end is to make a beginning,&quot; university president Sorenson wrote. &quot;The end is where we start now.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  One couple wrote their epitaph in rhyming couplets that carried over from one headstone to the other. &quot;We had joy, we had fun,&quot; reads the headstone of William Perkins III. &quot;We had seasons in the sun,&quot; continues his wife Virginia on her adjoining headstone.<br>
  <br>
  Others took a tone of dry humor. &quot;Say it isn't so,&quot; lamented Albert Joseph Turbessi.<br>
  <br>
  John Thompson (Tim) Peters, a lawyer, wrote his epitaph in Latin: &quot;Res Ipsa Loquitur.&quot; He referred to a legal doctrine that says the facts are so obvious there is no need for further details. <br>
  <br>
  &quot;Remember-Return-Reflect-Renew-Receive-Reclaim.&quot; That's the thought carved into a stone bench installed for visitors.<br>
  <br>
  The joint grave project began in 2005 when the group submitted its plan to the cemetery board. It took the board four years before it approved the project.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;It wasn't that we were disagreeable to the idea,&quot; said Sylvia Faust, the board chairperson. &quot;But we got some complaints (from other plot owners). People generally don't like change.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  So, the board kept asking for changes to the plan until officials finally felt the site conformed to the complex regulations that New York state has set for cemeteries.<br>
  <br>
  Cemetery officials thought the friends' burial plot might be an original concept. They said they knew of friends buried next to each other. But they could not recall a cemetery project designed for such a large group or one planned in advance when the plot owners were alive.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;As far as I know, it (the Chautauqua friends' grave site) seems to be unique,&quot; said Robert Fells, executive director of the International Cemetery Crematory and Funeral Association which has 7,500 members. <br>
  <br>
  In August, I was invited to the Chautauqua plotters' summer picnic. I found about two dozen plotters chatting and snacking as they sipped chardonnay and pinot grigio.<br>
  <br>
  I asked &quot;Griff&quot; McDonald, a recently retired financial adviser from Ann Arbor, Mich., how it felt to be looking at his own grave.<br>
  <br>
  He was silent for a moment. Then, he smiled and said: &quot;You notice there's no (death) date on it. If there were, then I'd be worried.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Jane Buch, the wife of the late Denny Buch, said at first she thought the burial idea seemed &quot;a little bizarre.&quot; But then, she saw the positives in the plan--the yearly get-togethers and the fact that the project relieved everyone&mdash;particularly the plotters' children&mdash;from having to make last-minute burial arrangements.<br>
  <br>
  The adult children of the plotters were the subject of a meeting after the picnics. The plotters appealed to them to oversee the gravesite and maintain its beauty in the years ahead.<br>
  <br>
  Buch's daughter, Amy, said she was a little taken aback when she learned that she was not included with her parents. &quot;But now, that I see how it worked out, I feel good about it.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Amy became misty-eyed when she recalled her father's funeral. She said about 200 people came and memories of that day stay with her.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;We had a big celebration of his life. We all shared stories. There were tears. And there was laughter.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Then, we went to the Chautauqua golf club (where her father was a long-time member) and continued the celebration. It was like what you would see at a wedding. His presence was everywhere.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;People remembered him as a 'good man with a great smile.' And those words are on his grave stone.&quot; </font></p>
